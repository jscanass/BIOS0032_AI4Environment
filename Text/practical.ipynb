    "## Choosing an LLM model\n",
    "\n",
    "On Ollama, and other platforms like Hugging Face, you will find hundreds if not thousands of models to choose from.\n",
    "Have a look at [Ollama’s model library](https://ollama.com/search).\n",
    "This can be overwhelming!\n",
    "However, there are a few considerations to keep in mind when choosing a model:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Model Size**: This refers to the number of parameters the model has.\n",
    "  It is directly related to how big the model file is, how much memory (RAM) it needs, and how long it takes to generate a response.\n",
    "  A larger model is likely to generate better responses, but you may not have the hardware to run it.\n",
    "  In our environment, we have limited resources, so we will favour smaller, efficient models.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Intent and Specialisation**: Some models are \"generic,\" while others are trained for specific purposes like coding, mathematical reasoning, or safety reviews.\n",
    "  Choose one that aligns with your specific research goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Context Size**: Depending on the task, you may need a model with a large context window to process large chunks of text (like a full scientific paper) at once.\n",
    "  This is especially important for multi-step interactions where a long conversation needs to fit into the model's context.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Model Capabilities**: As we will see below, some models have \"thinking\" abilities, others can use \"tools\" (like calculators), and others can analyse images.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Recency**: More recent models are likely to perform better due to novel research and innovation in training techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "💡 Safety Note: Downloading unknown models can be risky, but any model from well-known AI labs or those that are highly popular on these platforms are safe to test.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today we will use two models:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Gemma 3 (by Google)** is an open-source model.\n",
    "  We are using a lightweight version today that features a 128k token context window (approx. 100,000 words), allowing it to process large chunks of text at once.\n",
    "  While it is multimodal and can analyse images, we will focus on its text-processing abilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Qwen 3 (by Alibaba)** is a specialised \"thinking model.\" Unlike standard LLMs that answer instantly, a thinking model generates a hidden chain of reasoning first.\n",
    "  This helps it handle complex logic and multi-step problems without making mistakes.\n",
    "  It is also designed for tool use, meaning it can work with external functions to increase its accuracy for specific tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Important note:* Because these are \"smaller\" models, they are more limited than the commercial versions, which are usually massive.\n",
    "However, all models share the main limitations, such as hallucinations (making up facts).\n",
    "The prompting tips we cover today are relevant to all models, large or small."
