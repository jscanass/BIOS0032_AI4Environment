    "## Choosing an LLM model\n",
    "\n",
    "On Ollama, and other platforms like Hugging Face, you will find hundreds if not thousands of models to choose from.\n",
    "Have a look at [Ollama’s model library](https://ollama.com/search).\n",
    "This can be overwhelming!\n",
    "However, there are a few considerations to keep in mind when choosing a model:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Model Size**: This refers to the number of parameters the model has.\n",
    "  It is directly related to how big the model file is, how much memory (RAM) it needs, and how long it takes to generate a response.\n",
    "  A larger model is likely to generate better responses, but you may not have the hardware to run it.\n",
    "  In our environment, we have limited resources, so we will favour smaller, efficient models.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Intent and Specialisation**: Some models are \"generic,\" while others are trained for specific purposes like coding, mathematical reasoning, or safety reviews.\n",
    "  Choose one that aligns with your specific research goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Context Size**: Depending on the task, you may need a model with a large context window to process large chunks of text (like a full scientific paper) at once.\n",
    "  This is especially important for multi-step interactions where a long conversation needs to fit into the model's context.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Model Capabilities**: As we will see below, some models have \"thinking\" abilities, others can use \"tools\" (like calculators), and others can analyse images.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Recency**: More recent models are likely to perform better due to novel research and innovation in training techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "💡 Safety Note: Downloading unknown models can be risky, but any model from well-known AI labs or those that are highly popular on these platforms are safe to test.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today we will use two models:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Gemma 3 (by Google)** is an open-source model.\n",
    "  We are using a lightweight version today that features a 128k token context window (approx. 100,000 words), allowing it to process large chunks of text at once.\n",
    "  While it is multimodal and can analyse images, we will focus on its text-processing abilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Qwen 3 (by Alibaba)** is a specialised \"thinking model.\" Unlike standard LLMs that answer instantly, a thinking model generates a hidden chain of reasoning first.\n",
    "  This helps it handle complex logic and multi-step problems without making mistakes.\n",
    "  It is also designed for tool use, meaning it can work with external functions to increase its accuracy for specific tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Important note:* Because these are \"smaller\" models, they are more limited than the commercial versions, which are usually massive.\n",
    "However, all models share the main limitations, such as hallucinations (making up facts).\n",
    "The prompting tips we cover today are relevant to all models, large or small."

    "**1. Long-Term Trends & Broad Scale Impacts:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Title:** \"Climate change alters the spatial range of migratory bats\"\n",
    "   * **Authors:**  Ryan McAllister, et al.\n",
    "   * **Journal:** *Nature*, 2021\n",
    "   * **Impact:** This is arguably *the* landmark paper on this topic. It used a combination of bat tracking data (radar, radio tags), climate modeling, and species distributions to demonstrate a significant northward shift in the ranges of multiple migratory bat species across North America. It strongly links range shifts directly to warming temperatures and altered wind patterns. It’s been hugely influential. \n",
    "   * **Key Findings:** Demonstrated predictable northward shifts in bat ranges, linked to changes in wind regimes, which bats use for efficient flight. Highlighted the vulnerability of bats at the southern edges of their ranges.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Title:** “Climate change influences migration routes and stopover sites of migratory bats”\n",
    "   * **Authors:** David A. Smith, et al.\n",
    "   * **Journal:** *Global Ecology and Biogeography*, 2020\n",
    "   * **Impact:** Utilizes a large dataset of bat migration tracking to reveal how changing climate conditions are altering migration routes and the timing of stopover arrival.\n",
    "   * **Key Findings:** Highlighted shifts in timing and routes, especially linked to changes in temperature and rainfall, demonstrating how bats are actively adapting to new conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Physiological & Behavioral Responses:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Title:** \"Climate-induced shifts in bat migration timing and energetic demands\"\n",
    "   * **Authors:**  Elizabeth H. Baker, et al.\n",
    "   * **Journal:** *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences*, 2020\n",
    "   * **Impact:**  A highly cited paper exploring the physiological consequences of climate-induced shifts in bat migration.\n",
    "   * **Key Findings:** Showed that bats responding to warmer temperatures were experiencing earlier migration onset and increased energetic demands (higher metabolic rates) during the journey.  This suggests bats are energetically ‘running’ to stay ahead of climate change.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Title:** \"Bat migration under climate change: a meta-analysis of movement ecology data\"\n",
    "   * **Authors:** Michael A. O’Neal, et al.\n",
    "   * **Journal:** *Biology Letters*, 2020\n",
    "   * **Impact:** A quantitative meta-analysis that pulls together data from numerous bat tracking studies to provide a more robust understanding of migration patterns and how they’re changing.\n",
    "   * **Key Findings:** Offered insights into the key drivers of bat migration, including temperature, wind, and landscape features, quantifying the strength of these influences.\n",

    "   * **Impact:** Focused on a well-studied bat species (Mexican free-tailed bats) and demonstrated the impacts of climate change on migration phenology (timing) with robust data.\n",
    "   * **Key Findings:**  Demonstrated earlier arrival at and departure from breeding grounds in response to warmer temperatures, with potential implications for reproductive success.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Title:** “Climate change is reshaping the migratory landscape of horseshoe bats”\n",
    "   * **Authors:** Matthew R. Davis, et al.\n",
    "   * **Journal:** *Science*, 2022\n",
    "   * **Impact:** This study examined the effects of climate change on horseshoe bats (a group facing significant declines), revealing shifts in migration timing and range, and highlighting the importance of understanding how changes in climate are impacting these vulnerable populations.\n",
    "   * **Key Findings:** Showed that changing wind patterns and temperature are affecting migration routes and the availability of suitable habitat for horseshoe bats, potentially exacerbating existing population declines.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4.  Modeling and Predictive Research:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Title:** \"Climate-driven shifts in bat migration routes: A multi-species model\"\n",
    "   * **Authors:**  Sarah J. Roulier, et al.\n",
    "   * **Journal:** *Ecography*, 2021\n",
    "   * **Impact:** Utilizes modeling to predict future bat migration shifts under different climate change scenarios.\n",
    "   * **Key Findings:** Provided projections of range shifts and altered migration routes, offering valuable information for conservation planning.\n",

    "* **Ongoing Research:** This field is rapidly evolving, with new studies published frequently.\n",
    "* **Data Limitations:** Bat tracking data has limitations (e.g., tag weight, battery life).\n",

    "\n",
    "The core idea is simple: an LLM can be given the ability to invoke external functions to enhance its capabilities.\n",
    "Instead of relying solely on its static training data, the model can interact with the external world when it needs more information.\n",
    "\n",
    "A common example is conducting searches of the web via a search engine.\n",
    "During its reasoning, the LLM might think it is worth doing some extra research and so indicates that it wants to use a web search tool.\n",
    "The LLM itself provides all the needed info on how to run that tool, for example what to search for, and the query is then executed.\n",
    "The search engine is not an LLM and the outputs are fed back to the LLM so that it can continue its reasoning with the tool's results now injected into its context.\n",
    "Other tools could include access to a calculator, a specific database like eBird, or any programmatic function you define.\n",
    "\n",
    "An **agent** is simply a loop where the model can access tools until it has enough information to finish the task.\n",

    "It also uses strong instruction constraints, i.e. what to include, what to exclude, output granularity, and where species must appear."
