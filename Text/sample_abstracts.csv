Integrated pest management (IPM) approaches are frequently highly dependent on the use of insecticides. Oxitec’s self-limiting (prevents the insects’ offspring from surviving to adulthood) Medfly technology (OX3864A) offers an approach to manage Medfly outbreaks and may offer improved sustainability and economics for area-wide programmes. Netted cages were used to evaluate OX3864A deployed for the first time outdoors as a preventative treatment to suppress wild Medfly. Comparative assessments examined sexual competitiveness, the relative performance of OX3864A releases at both adult and pupal life-stages, and the ability of OX3864A to protect against fruit damage. OX3864A males are as competitive as wild males. Deployment of both adult and pupal life-stages of OX3864A effectively reduce Medfly abundance, resulting in elimination of the target pest populations. OX3864A deployment as adults also demonstrated the beneficial attribute of protecting fruit quality to preserve marketable yield. Data for adult and pupal deployment strategies are encouraging for self-limiting technologies targeting Medfly populations and support a broader evaluation of OX3864A Medfly or further improved self-liming Oxitec strains of Medfly in open settings. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

The efficacy of parasitoids as biocontrol agents is influenced by biotic and abiotic factors. For example, hyperparasitoids can reduce the abundance of the primary parasitoids as well as modify their behavior. A field study was conducted at three contrasting elevations on Mount Kilimanjaro, Tanzania, to identify the parasitoids of aphids in smallholder bean farming agroecosystems. Sentinel aphids (Aphis fabae) on potted bean plants (Phaseolus vulgaris) were exposed in 15 bean fields at three elevations for 2 days. The sentinel aphids were then kept in cages in a greenhouse until emergence of the parasitoids, which were collected and preserved in 98% ethanol for identification. Of the 214 parasitoids that emerged from sentinel aphids, the greatest abundance (44.86%) were from those placed at intermediate elevations (1000–1500 m a.s.l), compared to 42.52% from the lowest elevations and only 12.62% from the highest elevation farms. Morphological identification of the parasitoids that emerged from parasitized aphids showed that 90% were Aphidius species (Hymenoptera: Braconidae: Aphidiinae). Further characterization by sequencing DNA ‘mini-barcodes’ identified parasitoids with ≥99% sequence similarity to Aphidius colemani, 94–95% sequence similarity to Pachyneuron aphidis and 90% similarity to a Charipinae sp. in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database. These results confidently identified A. colemani as the dominant primary aphid parasitoid of A. fabae in the study area. A Pachyneuron sp., which was most closely related to P. aphidis, and a Charipinae sp. occurred as hyperparasitoids. Thus, interventions to improve landscapes and farming practice should monitor specifically how to augment populations of A. colemani, to ensure any changes enhance the delivery of natural pest regulation. Further studies are needed for continuous monitoring of the hyperparasitism levels and the dynamics of aphids, primary parasitoids, and secondary parasitoids in different cropping seasons and their implications in aphid control. © 2019 by the authors.

As more insect-associated species of nematodes are discovered and described, it is possible that scavengers and kleptoparasites may be mischaracterized as EPNs. If a nematode species is truly an entomopathogen it should display similar infectivity, as well as behaviors and preferences, to those of established EPN species, such as Steinernema carpocapsae. In this study we evaluated dauers of the putative EPN species Oscheius chongmingensis. We examined virulence, odor preferences as a measure of host-seeking behavior, and features of its bacterial symbiont Serratia nematodiphila. We determined that O. chongmingensis behaves more like a scavenger than an EPN. Not only did O. chongmingensis exhibit very poor pathogenicity in Galleria mellonella (wax moth larvae), it also displayed odor (host-seeking) preferences that are contrary to the well-known EPN S. carpocapsae. We also found that the bacterial symbiont of O. chongmingensis was antagonistic to S. carpocapsae; S. carpocapsae IJs were unable to develop when S. nematodiphila was a primary food source. We conclude that there is insufficient evidence to support the characterization of O. chongmingensis as an EPN; and based on the attributes of its preferences for already-infected or deceased hosts, suggest that this nematode is a scavenger, which may be on an evolutionary trajectory leading to an entomopathogenic lifestyle. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",Entomopathogenic nematodes; Oscheius; Parasite; Scavenger,"animal; biological pest control; feeding behavior; microbiology; moth; parasitology; pathogenicity; physiology; Rhabditida; Serratia; virulence; Animals; Feeding Behavior; Moths; Pest Control, Biological; Virulence",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85072280024

Building a genomic resource to investigate the molecular mechanisms of cassava responses to T. urticae is vital for characterizing cassava resistance to mites. Based on the tolerance of cassava varieties to mite infestation (focusing on mite development rate, fecundity and physiology), cassava variety SC8 was selected to analyze transcriptomic and proteomic changes after 5 days of T. urticae feeding. Transcriptomic analysis revealed 698 and 2140 genes with significant expression changes under low and high mite infestation, respectively. More defense-related genes were found in the enrichment pathways at high mite density than at low density. In addition, iTRAQ-labeled proteomic analysis revealed 191 proteins with significant expression changes under low mite infestation. Differentially expressed genes and proteins were mainly found in the following defense-related pathways: flavonoid biosynthesis, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, and glutathione metabolism under low-density mite feeding and plant hormone signal transduction and plant-pathogen interaction pathways under high-density mite feeding. The plant hormone signal transduction network, involving ethylene, jasmonic acid, and salicylic acid transduction pathways, was explored in relation to the M. esculenta response to T. urticae. Correlation analysis of the transcriptome and proteome generated a Pearson correlation coefficients of R = 0.2953 (P < 0.01), which might have been due to post-transcriptional or post-translational regulation resulting in many genes being inconsistently expressed at both the transcript and protein levels. In summary, the M. esculenta transcriptome and proteome changed in response to T. urticae, providing insight into the general activation of plant defense pathways in response to mite infestation. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Cassava; iTRAQ labeling; RNA-seq; Tetranychus urticae; Transcriptome,biochemistry; biological control; cassava; fecundity; genomics; host-parasite interaction; metabolism; mite; parasite infestation; pest resistance; physiological response; phytohormone; proteomics; RNA; Acari; Manihot esculenta; Tetranychidae; Tetranychus urticae; plant protein; proteome; transcriptome; animal; antibiosis; food chain; genetics; Manihot; physiology; signal transduction; Animals; Antibiosis; Food Chain; Plant Proteins; Proteome; Signal Transduction; Transcriptome,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85067075926

Integrated pest management tactics rely on tracking insect populations and using this information to select and target management tactics. Our ability to predict when and where to best focus treatment relies on an understanding of long-term trends, but often any available monitoring data are limited in its duration. Here we present data collected over a 10-year period at a flour mill in the central part of the United States. Using traps placed both inside and outside a flour mill and baited with pheromone-lures for Plodia interpunctella (Hübner), Indianmeal moth, and Trogoderma variabile Ballion, warehouse beetle, we examine environmental and spatial variability in insect captures. We find that both species, inside and outside the mill, are highly influenced by seasonal patterns, with peaks of insect captures during the warm season (April through September). There is also consistency across time and space in trap capture for P. interpunctella with traps in an open location consistently capturing high numbers of insects. In contrast, T. variabile lacked consistency in trap capture but were most often not found in the same trap locations as P. interpunctella. Fumigations conducted within the facility appeared to have little impact on insect captures inside, with dynamics appearing to be driven more by broader seasonal patterns in activity. These data and analyses suggest that there is a larger population of these insects that are readily moving in and out of the structures, while fumigation treatments are only impacting a small portion of the overall population and tactics targeting immigration may be an important addition to the pest management program. © 2019 by the authors.

There are however very few studies on the variables associated with intraspecific diversity of parasitoid insects, especially regarding the relationship with spatial, biotic and abiotic ecological factors. Cotesia sesamiae is a Sub-Saharan stenophagous parasitic wasp that parasitizes several African stemborer species with variable developmental success. The different host-specialized populations are infected with different strains of Wolbachia, an endosymbiotic bacterium widespread in arthropods that is known for impacting life history traits, notably reproduction, and consequently species distribution. In this study, first we analyzed the genetic structure of C. sesamiae across Sub-Saharan Africa, using 8 microsatellite markers. We identified five major population clusters across Sub-Saharan Africa, which probably originated in the East African Rift region and expanded throughout Africa in relation to host genus and abiotic factors, such as Köppen-Geiger climate classification. Using laboratory lines, we estimated the incompatibility between the different strains of Wolbachia infecting C. sesamiae. We observed that incompatibility between Wolbachia strains was asymmetric, expressed in one direction only. Based on these results, we assessed the relationships between the direction of gene flow and Wolbachia infections in the genetic clusters. We found that host specialization was more influential on genetic structure than Wolbachia-induced reproductive incompatibility, which in turn was more influential than geography and current climatic conditions. These results are discussed in the context of African biogeography, and co-evolution between Wolbachia, virus parasitoid and host, in the perspective of improving biological control efficiency through a better knowledge of biological control agents’ evolutionary ecology. © 2019 Branca, Le Ru, Calatayud, Obonyo, Musyoka, Capdevielle-Dulac, Kaiser-Arnauld, Silvain, Gauthier, Paillusson, Gayral, Herniou and Dupas.",Cotesia sesamiae; Genetic structure; Host specialization; Parasitoid; Wolbachia,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85071695750

The nematodes Steinernema glaseri, Steinernema carpocapsae, and Heterorhabditis bacteriophora were reproduced in last instar larvae of the wax moth Galleria mellonella and the infective juveniles emerged were subjected to two capture treatments: white traps and plaster of Paris, the latter was utilized as a pre-conditioning treatment. A total of 1,000 infective juveniles were formulated in each sodium alginate bead with or without an alginate coating. The beads were stored at 23 ± 3°C and a bidistilled water suspension of nematodes was set as a control. The survivorship of these formulates and their infectivity on Galleria mellonella larvae were evaluated every 7d post-formulation (dpf). In beads without pre-conditioning juveniles nor coating, Steinernema carpocapsae had the higher survival rate (58.8%), the longest survival time (28 dpf) and the higher infectivity (100%) as well. Pre-conditioning improved the survival and infectivity of Steinernema glaseri by 22.5% at 21 dpf and 70.0% at 14 dpf, respectively.

We tested the efficiency and preference for prey life stages of three predator mites, one specialist (Phytoseiulus persimilis) and two generalists (Amblyseius swirskii and Iphiseius degenerans). We used two predator densities and performed the experiment under 'seminatural' conditions. We found that significantly less eggs and adult spider mites survived in the presence of P. persimilis compared to the control group, and this predator mite consumed more eggs at high density than the other predators. In the presence of A. swirskii fewer adult spider mites survived at low density compared to the control, whereas egg survival was lower than in the control group at both densities.

Such resistance prompts for the development of integrated pest management (IPM) programs that include novel pesticides being effective against the aphid. In the present study, we assessed lethal and sublethal effects of cycloxaprid, a novel chiral neonicotinoid pesticide developed in China, on A. gossypii. The lethal concentration at 50% (LC<inf>50</inf>) value of cycloxaprid on A. gossypii was estimated, using the dipping method, at 7.73 mg/L. The impact of a sublethal concentration (LC<inf>10</inf>) and a lethal concentration (LC<inf>40</inf>) of cycloxaprid on A. gossypii population growth and feeding behavior (using electrical penetration graph technique [EPG]), and its transgenerational effect were further assessed. Adult longevity and fecundity significantly decreased after exposure to LC<inf>40</inf> or LC<inf>10</inf> of cycloxaprid. Cycloxaprid with sublethal concentrations (especially LC<inf>40</inf>) had negative effects on phloem ingestion by A. gossypii. Additionally, the offspring of the adults exposed to LC<inf>40</inf> of cycloxaprid had shorter nymphal development duration and adult longevity than the control, and those from LC<inf>10</inf> and LC<inf>40</inf> treatments had lower adult fecundity and net productive rate. We demonstrated that cycloxaprid is a pesticide showing both lethal and sublethal activities, and transgenerational effects on A. gossypii; it may be useful for implementation in IPM programs against this aphid pest. © 2016 Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences",cotton aphid; electrical penetration graph (EPG); life table; neonicotinoid; sublethal; toxicity,"cycloxaprid; fused heterocyclic rings; insecticide; pyridine derivative; animal; aphid; drug effects; feeding behavior; fertility; longevity; toxicity testing; Animals; Aphids; Feeding Behavior; Fertility; Heterocyclic Compounds, 3-Ring; Insecticides; Longevity; Pyridines; Toxicity Tests",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84994091578

In its native and introduced range, H. halys is considered a pest of tree fruits, vegetables, legumes, and ornamental trees. The highly polyphagous nature of this insect as well as its vast dispersal capabilities, require an integrated approach to management. Here we focus on the potential impact of indigenous natural enemies on H. halys in woody ornamental nurseries in Maryland, USA. We sampled naturally field laid H. halys egg masses for mortality and parasitism rates in 2012 and 2013. Overall, egg mortality averaged 54% for both years, and increased within season and between years. The largest source of mortality was from egg parasitoids with mean parasitism rates of 30.73 and 39.63% in 2012 and 2013, respectively. Mortality from predation was much lower and averaged 4.61% by chewing and 2.53% by sucking predators. We found seven species of Hymenopteran egg parasitoids attacking H. halys eggs, with Anastatus reduvii being the dominant species comprising 61.17 and 79.12% of all parasitoids in 2012 and 2013, respectively. The observed increase in parasitism over time and female biased sex ratio of parasitoids suggests that native parasitoids may be responding to the novel host, H. halys. Consequently, the use of these native eupelmid egg parasitoids in augmentative or conservation biological control may be a viable H. halys management strategy in ornamental nurseries. © 2017, The Author(s).",Anastatus reduvii; Biological control; Native parasitoids; Parasitism; Predation,biological control; egg; field survey; mortality; natural enemy; parasitism; parasitoid; predation; Maryland; United States; Anastatus; Eupelmidae; Halyomorpha halys; Hexapoda,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85020227399

Despite appearances, these predator and prey mites are separated by some 400 Myr of evolution and radically different lifestyles. We present a 152-Mb draft assembly of the M. occidentalis genome: Larger than that of its favored prey, Tetranychus urticae, but considerably smaller than those of many other chelicerates, enabling an extremely contiguous and complete assembly to be built-the best arachnid to date. Aided by transcriptome data, genome annotation cataloged 18,338 protein-coding genes and identified large numbers of Helitron transposable elements. Comparisons with other arthropods revealed a particularly dynamic and turbulent genomic evolutionary history. Its genes exhibit elevated molecular evolution, with strikingly high numbers of intron gains and losses, in stark contrast to the deer tick Ixodes scapularis. Uniquely among examined arthropods, this predatory mite's Hox genes are completely atomized, dispersed across the genome, and it encodes five copies of the normally single-copy RNA processing Dicer-2 gene. Examining gene families linked to characteristic biological traits of this tiny predator provides initial insights into processes of sex determination, development, immune defense, and how it detects, disables, and digests its prey. As the first reference genome for the Phytoseiidae, and for any species with the rare sex determination system of parahaploidy, the genome of the western orchard predatory mite improves genomic sampling of chelicerates and provides invaluable new resources for functional genomic analyses of this family of agriculturally important mites. © American Society for Clinical Pathology, 2016.

Intensive unidirectional IGP of C. pelasgicum on O. laevigatus was observed under plant arena conditions: over 90 % of minute bugs were killed by spiders in the first 24 h. However, no negative interaction between C. pelasgicum and minute pirate bugs was found under different egg-density conditions with Orius alone, and the combination of two predator treatments displayed significantly higher predation rates than the spider-alone treatment after 24 h. Increased egg density did not affect control by predators, nor did it prompt a significant reduction in IGP. During a day–night bioassay, negative interaction between the two predators was found under night conditions, impacting on egg predation rates due to the combination of two predators. Predation of spiders on H. armigera eggs took place mainly at night, while predation by minute bugs was recorded both by day and by night.

Both predators consumed eggs and larvae, but only C. montrouzieri preyed upon pupae. In general, cannibalism decreased with shared prey abundance, regardless of species. A high level of asymmetry was found on intraguild predation, in favour of C. montrouzieri.

Unfortunately, tactics to manage A. planipennis are limited and difficult to evaluate, primarily because of the difficulty of detecting and delineating new infestations. Here we use data from a unique resource, the SL.ow A.sh M.ortality (SLAM) pilot project, to assess whether treating a small proportion of trees with a highly effective systemic insecticide or girdling ash (Fraxinus spp.) trees to serve as A. planipennis population sinks can result in discernable effects on A. planipennis population growth or ash mortality. Components of the SLAM pilot project included an extensive inventory of ash abundance across a heterogenous area encompassing >390km2, treatment of 587 ash trees with a highly effective systemic insecticide, and girdling 2658 ash trees from 2009 to 2012. Fixed radius plots were established to monitor the condition of >1000 untreated ash trees throughout the area from 2010 to 2012. While only a very small proportion of ash trees in the project area were either treated with insecticide or girdled, both tactics led to detectable reductions of A. planipennis densities and protected ash trees in areas surrounding the treatments. The number of trees treated with the systemic insecticide reduced larval abundance in subsequent years. In contrast, the area of phloem in the insecticide-treated trees had no discernable effect on A. planipennis population growth, indicating that the number of treated trees was more important than the size of treated trees. Significant interactions among girdled trees, larval density, and the local abundance of ash phloem indicate girdling trees has a positive, but complex potential as a management tactic. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",Agilus planipennis; Emamectin benzoate; Emerald ash borer; Fraxinus; Girdled ash trees; Invasive species,Gems; Insecticides; Population statistics; Agilus planipennis; Ash trees; Emamectin benzoate; Emerald ash borer; Fraxinus; Invasive species; Forestry; abundance; beetle; disease prevalence; disease treatment; insecticide; invasive species; mortality; pest control; population density; population growth; population structure; tree; North America; Agrilus planipennis; Hexapoda,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84939417542

A common resistance management strategy is rotating insecticides with different modes of action. By incorporating entomopathogenic organisms (fungi and bacteria), which have discrete modes of action compared to standard insecticides, greenhouse producers may preserve the effectiveness of insecticides used for suppression of western flower thrips populations. The objective of this study was to determine how different rotation programs that include entomopathogenic organisms (Beauveria bassiana, Isaria fumosoroseus, Metarhizium anisopliae, and Chromobacterium subtsugae) and commonly used standard insecticides (spinosad, chlorfenapyr, abamectin, and pyridalyl) may impact the population dynamics of western flower thrips adult populations by means of suppression. Eight-week rotation programs were applied to chrysanthemum, Dendranthema x morifolium plants and weekly counts of western flower thrips adults captured on yellow sticky cards were recorded as a means to evaluate the impact of the rotation programs. A final quality assessment of damage caused by western flower thrips feeding on foliage and flowers was also recorded. Furthermore, a cost comparison of each rotation program was conducted. Overall, insecticide rotation programs that incorporated entomopathogenic organisms were not significantly different than the standard insecticide rotation programs without entomopathogenic organisms in suppressing western flower thrips adult populations. However, there were no significant differences among any of the rotation programs compared to the water control. Moreover, there was no differential effect of the rotation programs on foliage and flower quality. Cost savings of up to 34% (in US dollars) are possible when including entomopathogenic organisms in the rotation program. Therefore, by incorporating entomopathogenic organisms into insecticide rotation programs, greenhouse producers can decrease costs without affecting suppression, as well as diminish selection pressure on western flower thrips adult populations, which may avoid or delay resistance development. © The Authors 2015.
