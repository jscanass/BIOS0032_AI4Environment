    "**What is Machine Learning?**\n",
    "\n",
    "In ecology, we often deal with complex systems where it's hard to write manual rules for every scenario.\n",
    "**Machine Learning (ML)** solves this by letting the computer discover patterns in data (Experience) to improve its accuracy (Performance) on a specific goal (Task).\n",
    "\n",
    "Or formally:\n",
    "\n",
    "> A computer program is said to learn from *experience (E)* with respect to some classes of *tasks (T)* and *performance measure (P)* if its performance can improve with E on T measured by P.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> M. T. Mitchell. 1997. Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**\n",
    "\n",
    "Identifying species in the field is time-consuming and requires expert knowledge.\n",
    "Machine Learning can help automate this process, allowing researchers to scale up studies.\n",
    "Imagine you are building a tool to identify British butterflies from field photos:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Task (T)**: Classifying a new photo into the correct butterfly species.\n",
    "- **Performance (P)**: The percentage of images correctly identified by the model.\n",
    "- **Experience (E)**: A large database of labeled butterfly images (e.g., from museum collections or iNaturalist).\n",
    "\n",
    "**How does a computer program learn?**\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many ways to learn from data, and we call each specific approach a **model**.\n",
    "Commonly models are **parameterised**, meaning they have internal \"dials\" (called **parameters**) that control their behavior.\n",
    "During a process called **fitting**, the computer uses an algorithm to automatically tune these dials so the model's output matches the training data as closely as possible.\n",
    "Once the parameters are optimised, the model is ready to make predictions on new data."

    "The most reliable way to select a model is to test multiple options and evaluate their performance (which we will cover in the next section).\n",

    "For instance, a **Logistic Regression** model is limited to linear patterns, resulting in relatively low capacity.\n",
    "In contrast, a Nearest Neighbor model (`k=1`) has very high capacity; it can practically adapt to fit any pattern present in a dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "While high-capacity models can capture complex relationships, they are prone to **overfitting**.\n",
    "They often memorize noise in the training data rather than the underlying true signal which leads to poor **generalizability** on new data.\n",
    "Conversely, low-capacity models are \"simpler\" and less prone to overfitting, though they may struggle to capture subtle nuances.\n",
    "\n",
    "Complex models (high capacity) can fit complex patterns however, because of this, they can easily overfit to the training data, leading to poor generalisability.\n",
