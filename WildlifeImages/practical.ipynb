    "## Camera traps\n",
    "\n",
    "**Camera traps** are static cameras set up in the wild to monitor animal populations.\n",
    "Typically, they are triggered by motion, capturing an image whenever an animal moves within the camera's field of view.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0b/Wildlife_camera_%2851121829491%29.jpg/960px-Wildlife_camera_%2851121829491%29.jpg\" alt=\"camera trap\" width=\"500\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The images from camera traps show which species are in an area and what they're doing.\n",
    "This data reveals how often animals appear, their activity times, and their general behaviour.\n",
    "Camera traps are also relatively easy to set up and are great for capturing a wide range of medium to large animals.\n",
    "\n",
    "By combining this animal data with environmental information, ecologists can answer important questions.\n",
    "For example, a key goal is to understand how wildlife reacts to human pressure.\n",
    "By comparing animal communities in areas with low versus high human impact, it's possible to find thresholds, or tipping points, where the ecosystem changes significantly.\n",
    "Finding these thresholds helps inform conservation decisions, like where to create a protected area or what land-use rules to set.\n",
    "Placing cameras strategically along these areas of varying human impact provides the data needed to answer these kinds of questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the cameras are collected, the biggest challenge is going through all the photos.\n",
    "A huge number of these images are \"false triggers\" with no animals, set off by things like waving grass.\n",
    "Even when an animal is in the photo, it can be hard to identify if the view is bad, it's too far away, or it's an unfamiliar species.\n",
    "On top of that, a single project can produce hundreds of thousands or even millions of images.\n",
    "Manually checking every photo is extremely slow and often impossible for large studies.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is one of the key ways AI is changing ecological work.\n",
    "It helps by automating the slow task of sorting photos, which in turn makes large-scale studies using camera traps possible.\n",
    "In this notebook, you will work with an example dataset from the Biome Health Project, learning how to use AI to process and analyse the collected imagery."

    "In the community conservancies, Maasai landowners partner with tourism companies and follow specific rules for grazing their cattle.\n",
    "This setup creates a clear gradient of human and livestock pressure, from highly protected land to areas with more grazing and human presence.\n",

    "To monitor wildlife, a team from UCL and local conservancy staff placed camera traps across the landscape.\n",
    "A systematic approach was used to ensure the entire area was sampled evenly.\n",

    "# MegaDetector\n",
    "\n",
    "Manually annotating millions of images is clearly not practical.\n",
    "This is where a pre-trained AI model can save a huge amount of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this notebook, we will use [**MegaDetector**](https://github.com/microsoft/CameraTraps/blob/main/megadetector.md), a model initially developed by Microsoft's AI for Earth program.\n",
    "It was trained on millions of camera trap images from many different ecosystems, so it's generally robust and reliable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Like any AI, MegaDetector learned to detect animals by looking at a huge library of training examples.\n",
    "It works best when your data is similar to what it was trained on. It might struggle with images from unique ecosystems or with different types of imagery (like from drones).\n",
    "No AI is perfect, and it will make mistakes.\n",
    "You can see some examples of known failure cases [here](https://github.com/agentmorris/MegaDetector/blob/main/megadetector-challenges.md).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few key things about it:\n",
    "\n",
    "* MegaDetector's purpose is to find and draw boxes around three types of objects: animals, people, and vehicles.\n",
    "  It doesn't identify the species of the animal, it just finds it.\n",
    "\n",
    "* MegaDetector is \"pretrained\".\n",
    "  This means it has already been trained on a large, general dataset.\n",
    "  We can take this general, pre-trained model and apply it directly to our own images without any additional train.\n",
    "\n",
    "* For every box it draws, MegaDetector provides a confidence score between 0 and 1.\n",
    "  A score close to 1.0 means the model is very certain about its detection (e.g., \"I'm 98% sure this is an animal\").\n",
    "\n",
    "* We can use these scores to automatically filter out empty images.\n",
    "  By setting a confidence threshold, we can decide that any detection below a certain score isn't a \"real\" detection.\n",
    "  Choosing this threshold is a trade-off: a lower threshold means you might find more animals but will also have to check more false positives.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Modern versions of MegaDetector use the YOLOv5 architecture.\n",
    "  YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a family of convolutional neural networks that has become an industry standard for real-time object detection."

    "The next step is typically to manually review all the non-empty images, or perhaps to build a custom species classifier.\n",
    "However, a new tool called [**SpeciesNet**](https://github.com/google/cameratrapai) offers another powerful, pre-trained solution, similar to MegaDetector but for species identification.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both models were trained on huge amounts of data.\n",
    "SpeciesNet, for example, was trained on around 65 million images from all over the globe (see [this paper](http://doi.org/10.1049/cvi2.12318) for more details).\n",
    "These images were collected, manually annotated by many different research teams, and then shared on platforms like Wildlife Insights.\n",
    "The result is a model that synthesises a vast amount of expert knowledge to identify animals in photos.\n",
    "Both models are also free and open-source, meaning you can inspect their code and use them however you like, as long as you attribute them correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "SpeciesNet is different from MegaDetector because it doesn't locate where an animal is in a photo.\n",
    "Instead, it looks at the *whole image* and tries to identify the species shown.\n",
    "Its current version can recognise 2,000 different classes of animals.\n",
    "If it can't identify the exact species, it will attempt to name a higher taxonomic category (like genus or family).\n",
    "Like MegaDetector, SpeciesNet also outputs a confidence score for each classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "In most scenarios, the two models are best used together.\n",
    "The ideal workflow is to run MegaDetector first to find and locate all the animals, then crop the image around each detection, and finally, run SpeciesNet on those smaller, cropped images to identify the species."

    "While our initial model gives us some insights, it has several major limitations common in basic ecological analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. By reducing data to binary \"presence/absence,\" we treat a site with 1 sighting the same as a site with 100 sightings.\n",
    "   We lose the information contained in the repeated visits (days the camera was active).\n",
    "   Advanced methods like **Occupancy Modelling** use this repetition to build a more accurate picture.\n",
    "2. We only included a few human pressure variables.\n",
    "   Critical natural factors like Canopy Cover (shade/protection) and other human infrastructure details were ignored, likely biasing our results.\n",
    "3. Our model assumes that if a camera didn't see an animal, the animal wasn't there.\n",
    "   In reality, animals are elusive.\n",
    "   We failed to account for detection probability—an animal might be present but hidden by bush or avoiding the camera.\n",
    "4. Why not Counts?\n",
    "   Using raw counts is problematic because, a single animal walking back and forth can generate 50 \"counts,\" misleading the model.\n",
    "   Also, cameras were active for different lengths of time.\n",
    "   A camera active for 30 days will naturally have higher counts than one active for 3 days, regardless of actual animal abundance.\n",
