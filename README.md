## Welcome to AI for the Environment Repository

The AI for the Environment (BIOS0032) module is part of the MSc in Ecology and Data Science offered at UCL (UCL East).

In this repo you will find the Jupyter notebooks that are used throughout the module.

## Aims of the Module

Understanding the impact of rapid environmental change on biodiversity, how species are adapting to land use and climate change, and how the degradation of nature impacts people and society is now critical to ensure healthy environments for both people and nature.

We are currently in the midst of a revolution in how we are monitoring our natural environment and assessing the impact of land use and climate change.
This is because of new high-resolution data streams that are being produced from a growing array of sensor technologies such as high-resolution satellite imagery, visual and audio sensor data, geospatial tracking devices and environmental DNA.
There is also a massive parallel revolution in new Artificial Intelligence and other data science tools which have the potential to transform our understanding of how to manage ecosystems and meet critical global challenges such as climate change mitigation and adaptation.

But, how do we apply these new tools to analyse these new ecological and environmental data?
This module aims to advance your knowledge and analytical skills in order to progress from obtaining environmental sensor data, to processing, modelling, visualising and inferring wildlife abundance, occupancy and distribution changes in response to climate and land use change using appropriate statistical tools in R and Python.

## Course Archives

The material in the main branch is updated for the current academic year.
We archive previous versions of the module to separate branches for reference.

You can switch to previous years by selecting the branch name from the dropdown menu in GitHub.

> [!WARNING]
> Note on Archived Content: While the code in archived branches remains valid, external integrations (such as Google Colab buttons) and some relative image paths may break because they often point to the default main branch.

## Structure

The repository is organised by topic/week. Each folder contains:
- Jupyter notebooks for the practical sessions.
- A version of the notebooks with solutions to the exercises.
- Any data or code required for that specific practical.
