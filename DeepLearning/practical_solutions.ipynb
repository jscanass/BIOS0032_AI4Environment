    "It involves designing architectures with sometimes millions or billions of parameters and optimising them using gradient descent—the process by which training loss is reduced and model parameters are adjusted.\n",
    "These operations must also be computationally efficient to minimise training and inference time.\n",
    "Fortunately, several libraries provide high-level tools to handle these complexities, making it easier to create and train models effectively.\n",

    "Although there are specialised reasons to choose one over another, either is suitable for most problems; the choice usually depends on convenience and personal preference.\n",
    "`PyTorch` is often preferred in academic circles because it is intuitive and flexible, making it ideal for quick experimentation.\n",
