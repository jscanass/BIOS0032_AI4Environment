    "\n",
    "As you have seen in the lecture, we have different types of remote sensing data at our disposal:\n",

    "* Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)\n",
    "* Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS), respectively Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR)\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these uses a different portion of the electromagnetic spectrum, ranging from thermal\n",
    "infrared (longest wavelength) via short-wave and near-infrared to the visible range (red, green,\n",
    "blue), rarely to Ultraviolet (shortest wavelength). Furthermore, SAR and LiDAR (and sonar by the\n",
    "way, which is used for underwater sensing) are **active** sensors, that is, they emit their own\n",
    "radiation and measure properties of what bounces back from the Earth. Optical sensors in turn\n",
    "measure the reflected _irradiance_ from the sun.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can imagine, optical sensors can be categorised by their _spatial_ resolution (just like your\n",
    "camera – how many megapixels, _etc._). However, they can also differ in their **spectral**\n",
    "resolution, which includes the number of spectral _bands_ and the bandwidth:\n",
    "* RGB sensors just measure one band each in the red, green, and blue wavelengths.\n",
    "* **Multispectral** sensors include at least one band beyond the visible range.\n",

    "From this list and your choices, you may be able to make the following observations:\n",

    "  and vegetation).\n",
    "* Some are downright useless for our scene (but remember that they might work in other settings,\n",
    "  such as with more bare soil).\n",
    "* Not all indices are of the same format of \"(band a - band b) / (band a + band b)\"; they can become\n",
    "  quite elaborate.\n",
    "* Some indices have been developed for specific sensors in mind. For example, the Enhanced\n",
    "  Vegetation Index (EVI) is a very popular choice and should perform much better than NDVI over\n",
    "  rainforest (where the latter saturates, as you have seen above). However, EVI has been developed\n",
    "  for the [MODIS](https://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/about/) mission and contains correction factors that\n",
    "  do not automatically work for other sensors. Thus, if you try to calculate EVI for Sentinel-2\n",
    "  using the default formula, it likely won't give you good results.\n",

    "  We could estimate this by taking samples of soil pixels and measuring their reflectance ratio\n",

    "  correlated with them. An example of those is the Leaf Area Index (LAI), which is the ratio of the\n",

    "   shape with undulations (valleys, mountains); therefore, an ellipsoid is used that approximates\n",

    "   world. Almost every country has multiple of them ([references for the\n",
    "   UK](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-geospatial-data-standards-coordinate-reference-systems)).\n",
    "2. Once the CRS is defined, we need to know where in relation to it the image comes to lie. For\n",
    "   regularly taken datasets, this can be done with an [affine transformation\n",
    "   matrix](https://pygis.io/docs/d_affine.html) (as used above). Affine matrices allow linear\n",
